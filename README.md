## Overview :

Build a Todo Management app using React Native that allows users to organize their tasks into
categories such as Todos, Completed, and Deleted. The app should also include a "Create New"
button that navigates the user to a new screen where they can add a new todo by
providing a title and description. Additionally, there should be a button to generate fake todo data using this api
(https://dummyjson.com/docs/todos)

## Instructions:

- Use the dummyJSON Todos API (https://dummyjson.com/docs/todos) to fetch todos data.
- You must use React-query to handle fetching, and react-form-hook & zod to create the form and validate the inputs
- You must use react-native-navigation for navigating between the two screens (todos, createTodo)
- The app should be compatible with both Android and iOS devices.
- Feel free to use any design and layout that you think works best for this app.

## How to deliver:

- Provide a GitHub repository link with the source code of the app.
- Include a README file with instructions on how to run the app and any other relevant information.
